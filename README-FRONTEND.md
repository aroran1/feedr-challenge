# Frontend Challenge 

This is a full stack app that contains:
- on the front end, a static mock of an internal tool used to build sub-menus from a supplier's items
- on the back end, a simple API endpoint that returns a list of items.

In a working version of the application, users should be able to select items from the left-hand sidebar and have them appear in the Menu preview.

## Part 1 - by yourself (1-2hrs)

For this challenge we would like you to:

- Populate items in the left-hand sidebar with data from the /api/items endpoint.
- Allow users to select items in the left-hand sidebar and have them appear in the Menu Preview on the right hand side.
- Allow users to filter items in the left-hand sidebar by name. You can modify the server code.
- Be able to remove items from the menu by clicking the (x)
- Show the total number of selected items in the header
- Show the total number of each dietary type selected in the header

We are looking for: 
- clean code
- sensible component structure and data management 
- sensible testing plan - we like tests, but we like *useful* tests 

We do not want you to:

- Overstyle the application. Please don't spend time writing a bunch of CSS.
- Worry too much about browser compatibility or responsiveness - this is an internal tool used only on desktops. 

Please feel free to add additional notes in `README.md` outlining your thought process. Provide as much detail as you like (or none at all!). These will be used to create talking points during your interview.


## Part 2 - pairing with a Feedr developer (~1hr)

We'll then take the code that you've already written and add a simple feature to extend it.


If you have any issues please email mark@feedr.co.

Good luck!
